                            <p>Group Coaching continues to increase in popularity for coaches and clients alike. Grounded in our core coaching competencies, group coaching brings the coaching conversation into a small group context. It is an intimate conversation space, focused on goal setting, deepening awareness around key issues, taking action, and accountability. For a group to be considered group coaching the ICF has set the upper threshold group size at 15. Most groups are much smaller, particularly those in the virtual environment.<br>

Over the past few years, coaches have continued to expand the boundaries of group coaching. Whether you are a coach designing your own programs for parents, small business owners, those exploring work-life issues, or you are working with groups in an organization, group coaching offers many benefits to coach and client alike. Group coaching is both a virtual and in-person modality. Many coaches and clients enjoy the connections formed virtually with other participants, who may be several time zones and countries away.<br>

The Benefits of Group Coaching:<br><br>
Group coaching clients benefit from the peer learning with others, commonly referred to as the collective wisdom of the group. This peer learning is often as important as the interaction with the coach. Many clients find the process "less on the spot", giving them more time to reflect and integrate their insights. Masterful group coaches step back and create a strong process framework for the coaching to emerge from.<br>

Coaches may find that group coaching is a powerful way to leverage their time and resources, enabling them to work with more clients over less time, potentially at a lower price point per person.<br>

Organizations may find benefit due to the scalable nature of the process, opening up communication between silos or group members in different parts of the organization. Over time these relationships create a valuable network across an organization. Group coaching can also be positioned as a training follow-on, supporting learners to with the transfer and application of their learning, creating an on-going accountability structure. Group coaching is an on-going conversation, which supports change over time.<br>

What group coaching looks like:<br><br>
Group coaching is taking many forms globally, given that it is driven and shaped by the various needs of different client groups. The group coaching conversation can feel "wide and broad" rather than the deep, deep dive of an individual coaching conversation.<br>

Example #1: A group coaching program for female leaders exploring work life issues - ongoing in person corporate sessions over several months.<br>

Example #2: Group coaching for new managers as a follow-on to leadership training, with conversations occurring monthly over a year.<br>

Example #3: A three month bi-weekly program offered virtually (by phone) for business owners, with a mix of small group and individual coaching calls.<br></p>

                            <p>A mastermind group is a group of peers who regularly meet in order to give each other guidance, advice, and support.<br>

It is no secret that mastermind groups are essential to operating a successful business, growing your business entity, and achieving your goals and dreams.<br>

Keep in mind that the ultimate goal of these meetings is helping members navigate complex and difficult business challenges and issues using the collective experiences and insights of the larger group.<br>

While it is similar to mentoring, note that it has a few important differences.<br>

Firstly, a mastermind group will likely have five to six members, rather than being a one-to-one meeting. If you are in a mastermind group, then you will both receive and offer advice and insights. On the other hand, in a mentorship, people are typically on the receiving end.<br>

Also, remember that a mastermind group can involve educational presentations, brainstorming, and even the discussion of personal issues.<br>

So, these groups are great as they typically provide you with guided opportunities for good group education, designed to improve and sharpen members’ skills. In every sense, they’re a “meeting of the minds” – places where you can truly speak the truth and expect the truth in return.</p>

                            <p>One to one Coaching<br>
One to one coaching is designed to help people create change in themselves. Usually this means improving a skill or capability in order to achieve a personal objective. In many organisations employees are encouraged to set personal objectives in line with the company goals, so one to one coaching should have a positive impact on business performance.
However, as work becomes more collaborative it’s more important to work alongside or even rely upon our teammates to reach our own goals. So how can we adapt one to one coaching to help us reach our goals while considering the importance of collaboration?<br>
Know yourself<br>
One to one coaching can help improve self awareness as well as skills, and with greater self awareness comes better collaboration.<br>
Self awareness<br>
Coaches will prompt their clients to reflect more often and experiment with changes in their own behaviours. A good place to start is to think about how how your personality and values affect your work. Anyone who’s taken a personality test has probably taken some time at the end of the test to consider if it’s a true reflection of themselves but often that’s the extent of how the tests are used. Spending some time digesting and translating psychometrics into a ‘personal profile’ can help both you and your teammates understand how you work alone and with others.<br>
Self management<br>
From here you can start to adapt the way you work to reach your personal goals and to increase your own engagement. Do you use your strengths every day at work? Are you clear about your personal goals? How do you deal with stress and how can you minimise stressful situations?<br>
Social awareness<br>
Take an interest in the people around you. As we mentioned earlier we often depend on others to get our jobs done and hit our goals. Therefore one to one coaching doesn’t mean just focusing on the individual.To improve the way we work means considering the people around us, what influences them at wok and how we can adapt our own working styles to reduce conflict.<br>
Know your team<br>
Team coaching is about the team creating collective change. It takes the growth and learning one step further than one to one coaching. So rather than individuals improving their skills and social awareness to achieve their own goals, the team are coached to work together to achieve a shared goal. Team coaching involves everyone in the team, including the leader, so there’s collective accountability and shared benefit for everyone in the team.<br>
It’s more complex than individual coaching but likely to have a bigger impact. Even if the whole team are receiving individual coaching they will be working at different paces and focussing on different goals, therefore there’s often an imbalance between those in the team pushing for better team performance and those solely focussed on their own goals.
This isn’t to say that team members would be letting the team down by focussing on their own goals, individuals should absolutely have their own aims that motivate and drive them. But alongside this teams should share a common goal to ensure company growth, which in turn means reward for individual and team performance.<br>
How team coaching works<br>
Team coaching helps people understand how to work better with others. This is either by understanding relationships in the team to reduce conflict, focussing on how people interact and communicate, or helping teams to clarify a shared purpose, goals and roles.
We’ve spent hundreds of hours researching the best approach to team coaching, reviewing academic research, books, talking to coaches and teams and have concluded that the best team coaching involves a combination of all three of the approaches above.</p>
